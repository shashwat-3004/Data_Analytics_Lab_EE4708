Logistic regression is a classical classification method in statistical machine learning that uses a logistic function to model binary dependent variable. The main idea behind
logistic regression is to use sigmoid function to nonlinearize multivariate linear regression. In this paper, we explain the theory behind logistic regression and try to understand the effect or parameters key to the survival of a person had they been on the
famous Titanic ship. The survival prediction has been done by using Logistic regression.
