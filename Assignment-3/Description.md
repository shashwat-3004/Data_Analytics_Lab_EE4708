Naive Bayes is a term that is collectively used forclassification algorithms that are based on Bayes Theorem.It isa probabilistic classifier. It is called ”naive” because it makes
the assumption that the occurrence of a certain feature isindependent of the occurrence of other features. In this paper,we implement naive Bayes technique on a dataset and classify
whether a person earns more than $50K a year or not. We studyhow factors like age, work class, level of education, occupation,
gender etc. affect the income of a person.
