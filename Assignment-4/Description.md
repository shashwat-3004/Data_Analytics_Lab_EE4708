# Assignment-4

Decision Trees are a type of supervised machine
learning algorithm where the data is continuously divided into
different categories on the basis of certain parameters. It is like a
tree structure that works on certain conditions. Tree algorithms
are always preferred due to stability and reliability. In this
paper, we explain the theory behind the decision trees and try to
understand what parameters are most important while classifying
a car based on different parameters.
