# Assignment-5

Random Forest is a supervised machine learning
algorithm that is constructed from multiple decision trees. It is
used for both regression as well as classification problems. It
utilizes ensemble learning, which is a technique that combines
many classifiers to provide solutions to a problem. In this paper,
we explain the theory behind the random forest classifier and
try to understand what parameters are most important while
classifying a car based on different parameters.
