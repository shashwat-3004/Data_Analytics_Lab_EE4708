# Assignment-6

Support vector machine is a supervised machine
learning algorithm that is used for solving both classification
and regression problem but it is mostly used for classification.
The data is plotted in n-dimensional space with the value of
each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Support
Vectors are simply the coordinates of individual observation. In
this paper , we explain the theory of support vector machine and
try to understand what parameters are helpful in determining
whether a neutron star is a pulsar or not.
